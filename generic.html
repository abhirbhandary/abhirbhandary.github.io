								<p>As a data analyst, I possess 1 year of experience which I gained after my bachelor's degree. I had an opportunity to learn further and serve my nation for 10 years as a teacher in an engineering college.</p>
								<p>I hold a Doctor of Computer Science & Engineering degree, which is a testament to my dedication to academic excellence. During my work as a teacher, I taught computer and information science-related subjects. I used to take classes every day for students and have organized and given various workshops which gave me valuable experience in leadership and organization. I have prepared notes and assignments for students and published papers on my research in various reputable international journals.</p>
								<p><h4>Answer to the question - 'Why Career Change?'</h4></p>

								<p>“Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.” I had completed all my aspirations in teaching and reached the highest qualification in my profession. My wife had moved to Germany and started working. I decided to take up a new challenge in life. Data for good is always something that was something very close to me. The best place to start was from the beginning. </p>
								<p>In addition to my professional aspirations, I was a mentor for a student group called <a href=" https://www.instagram.com/vista_nmamit/ ">'VISTA'. </a> I also administer a Facebook group called <a href=" https://www.facebook.com/groups/940278203923625/ "> 'Indian family reunion visa for Germany' </a> with more than 1000 members. The group provides members with all information related to spouse visas and helps connect people from various places. I believe it is my way to give back to the community and help people.</p>
								<p>My diverse experiences have taught me resilience, perseverance, and a strong work ethic, which I am excited to apply to my career as a data analyst. I am eager to continue learning, growing, and contributing my skills to the field.</p>
